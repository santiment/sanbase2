defmodule Sanbase.Clickhouse.Query.Environment do
  @moduledoc ~s"""
  Each query is executed in an execution environment.

  An environment is represented as its bindings -- a map of key-value pairs.
  The environment bindings are provided by Santiment Backend. The bindings
  could be different for different users. Such an example is the `@me`/`@owner`
  binding, which refers to the owner of the query/dashboard.
  Other bindings are the same for everyone -- like the `@assets` binding, which
  is map, where the key is an asset's slug like `bitcoin`, and the value is another
  map with the asset's data -- name, ticker, description, github organizations,
  contract addresses, etc.

  An example showing why it is needed: A Dashboard creator wants to add an
  'About me' text widget in the top right corner of all of their dashboards.
  It includes the author name, email, twitter, and telegram handle.
  What would happen if that person wants to change their email address?
  They don't need to go through all of their dashboards and change the email manually.
  The user can use the `@me` environment variable that is populated automatically
  with the query/dashboard owner details -- they just need to use a template and an
  env var like this -- `{{@me["email"]}}
