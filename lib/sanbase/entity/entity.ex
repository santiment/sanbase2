  Provide unified access to all sanbase defined entities.

  Entities include:
  - Insight
  - Watchlist
  - Screener
  - Timeline Event
  - Chart Configuration

  This module provides functions for fetching lists of entities of a given type,
  ordered in a specific way. There are two orderings:
  - most recent first
  - most voted first
