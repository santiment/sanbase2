defmodule Sanbase.Entity do
  @moduledoc ~s"""
  Provide unified access to all sanbase defined entities.

  Entities include:
  - Insight
  - Watchlist
  - Screener
  - Chart Configuration
  - Alerts
  - Address Watchlist

  This module provides functions for fetching lists of entities or counts of entities of a given type,
  ordered in a specific way. There are two orderings:
  - Most recent first
  - Most voted first

  ## Shared Options

  Almost all of the repository functions outlined in this module accept the following
  options:
    * `:page` - The page as a positive integer when fetching lists of entities.
    * `:page_size` - The page size as a positive integer when fetching lists of entities
    * `:cursor` - A map that serves as a datetime filter. It contains two fields - :type,
       that can be either :before or :after and a :datetime, which is a DateTime.t() struct.

  # The list of supported entitiy types. In order to add a new entity type, the
  # following steps must be taken:
  # 1. Implement the Sanbase.Entity behaviour in the entity module. It forces
  # implementation of functions that generate the SQL query and fetch entities
  # by ids in a given order.`
  # 2. Implement the public function deduce_entity_type/1 in this module
  # 3. Implement the private functions entity_ids_query/2 and
  #    deduce_entity_module/1 in this module
  # 4. Extend the CASE blocks and the group_by clause in the do_get_most_voted/2
  # 5. Check if extending the deduce_entity_creation_time_field/1 is necessary.
  #    It is necessary if the new entity needs to use a different than
  #    inserted_at field to check its creation time. For example, insights have
  #    their published_at time taken, not inserted_at
