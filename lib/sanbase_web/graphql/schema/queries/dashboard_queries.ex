    Get the last computed version of a dashboard.

    The query returns a list of the last computation of every
    panel. The panel computation (cache) is described by its
    id and a JSON-formatted string of the result. The result
    contains the column names, the column types, the rows and
    the time they were computed. The SQL and arguments that
    were used to compute the result can be found in the dashhboard
    schema, fetched by the getDashboardSchema query.

    This is called a cache because only the latest result is
    stored and all previous states are discarded. Storing data
    for long time after other computations and changes are done
    is done via snapshots (to be implemented).
