For certain coins, this indicator tends to bottom at the lowest point of its bear market and peak at the top of its bull cycle. Negative values mean that short-term holders are going to realize higher profits than long-term holders if they sell at price at this moment. Positive values show the opposite.This an oscillating indicator, which reaches extreme negative values at the bottom of the large bear cycles and extreme positive values at the top of the bull markets. The intuition is that at the top of the bull runs the long term holders are at large profit and this puts large sell pressure. At the bottom of the bear markets, the long term holders are at large loss and are not willing to sell. Compared to the individual MVRVs, this indicator is going to give negative values when both long and short term holders are at the same profit and loss, thus indicating that the current price is not the long term top/bottom, but more of a short term move."
